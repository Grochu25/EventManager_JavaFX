This is one of the assigned projects at my university. 
(Originally it was C# project, but I decided to write it also in Java to learn JavaFX).
Application is a simple event manager where you can add, remove, import and export events from xml files.
All events have: name, description, date*, type and priority.
To check event description, click event twice.
You can filter displayed events by their date, type and priority.
You can also sort events by clicking proper column header.


*At the moment there is only date without specific hour, because lack of good implementation of DateTimePicker in JavaFX
